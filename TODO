WELCOME
-------
Hello! This is my todo list for Tournaments Enhanced.

FIX
---
S Don't hide Select Prize button after selecting a prize
S Enable determinism in random number generator (does bannerlord provide a random number api?)
S replace WeeksSinceHostedTournament with DaysUntilCanHostTournament and persist value

TEST
----
Write unit tests for existing methods with NUnit, Moq, and Shouldly

IMPROVE
-------
TournamentTypeComparer, use for more than just overrides. E.g. sort by Prosperity for such tournys, Payor's appeal of towns (distance + prosperity + number of lords for lord tourny)  
Can only override underling's' tournaments.
Worsten relations with previous payor if new payor steals their tournament
A payor friendly with another payor may decide not to steal tournament

REFACTOR
--------
S Move all numeric constants and magic numbers to separate "default values" constants file for easier tweaking of numbers
S add "best experience" version that requires harmony and mcm
refactor EncounterGameMenuBehavior from BehaviorBase and rename BehaviorBase

INVESTIGATE
-----------
L companions joining in fights have incorrect or missing icon. May be bug in Bannerlord?
S How many days until a tournament goes away on its own?
S investigate other tournament logic

OPTION
------
Make number of companions in tournament configurable (was/is 10)
Make companion selection window, or add criteria or block/allow list of companions that fight in tournament

DESCRIBE
--------


BUILD
-------------
S Clean up output folder of bannerlord folder to clear pdb
S Parameterize SubModule.xml to get version number dynamically

CREATE
------

SPIKE is jousting feasible?
XL Grand Tournaments, happening every x months, announced to player before it happens 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week, and when tournament begins
  -What should defining characteristics be? Need high renown to compete? Pay to enter? Noble-worthy prizes? Much larger monetary and social gains?
SM add mod options input to change language
S if language is default option, select language from Bannerlord
M externalize text resources for multilanguage support
Menu to select who comes with you (choose preferred order of companion or spouse or a troop)

SPIKE full item tooltips in prize selection screen? (try ImprovedTooltips mod for examples)

SM Make settlement choice for tournaments as such:
    -random
    -one per side
    -if can't have for a side then none for that side
    -if cant have for both sides, then none at all
    -do tournaments every go away?
        -if not, allow peace tournament in city that already has one

SM add notification that tournament is happening, and why, to the town description and menu items if possible


SM Add tiny flag icon to towns with tournament (see SettlementIcons mod)


M tournament champion "leaderboards" for towns, nations, and empire (or "world") (NOT online leaderboards)
